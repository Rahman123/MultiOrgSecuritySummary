# MultiOrgSecuritySummary

Multi-Org Security Summary gives you the ability to bring all of the Security Health Check data from all of your Salesforce environments(production &amp; sandbox) into a single org! This allows you to get a clear picture of the security health of your entire Salesforce program and manage your team of Admins more efficiently.
